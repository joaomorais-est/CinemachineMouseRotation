# CinemachineMouseRotation
A (very) simple Unity example project for a specific class (Desenvolvimento de videojogos) of the Computer Science course at Set√∫bal Polythecnic University - School of Technology. This is meant to help my students with a Cinemachine Freelook Camera that rotates with mouse movement.  

The existing script code in this project is based on the Unity forum thread: https://forum.unity.com/threads/how-do-i-make-a-cinemachinefreelook-orbiting-camera-that-only-orbits-when-the-mouse-key-is-down.527634/

However, the students needed the middle mouse button to rotate the camera (instead of the right mouse button like in the thread).
